    "\"Meet Jack, a man who seemed to have a sixth sense for missing appointments. His friends and family had grown accustomed to his tardiness, but it still managed to frustrate him. Jack was a good person, but his love of sleep and relaxation often led him to oversleep, only to realize with a jolt that he was running late.\\nIt started when Jack was in high school. His friends would text him at 7:00 AM on game day, reminding him to meet up at the stadium at 8:00 AM. Jack would wake up at 6:30 AM, stumble out of bed, and rush to the stadium, only to realize he had overslept. His friends would chuckle and say, \\\"Dude, you're going to miss the game!\\\"\\nAs Jack entered adulthood, his tardiness continued. He would wake up late, often by 30 minutes, and then rush to work, only to realize he had forgotten his lunch or his keys. His boss would roll his eyes and say, \\\"Jack, you're always late. How do you expect to get anything done?\\\"\\nDespite his friends' teasing, Jack tried to be more punctual. He set alarms on his phone, woke up earlier\""
